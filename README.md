# KAFKA-DOCKER

## Running docker-compose.yml

```bash
$ docker-compose up 
```
kafka will be available at kafka:9094 <br>
Control-panel will be available at http://localhost:9021

<br>
<br>
If stoped container running, for run again, needs to run "down" command of docker-compose and run "up" command again

<br>
<br>

```bash
$ docker-compose down

$ docker-compose up -d
```
